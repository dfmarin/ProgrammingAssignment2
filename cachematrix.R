## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and caching the
## inverse of a matrix rather than compute it every time is a good idea

## makeCacheMatrix(): returns a list of functions used to 
## set/get the matrix, and set/get the inverse of the matrix
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}

## cacheSolve(): returns the inverse of the matrix.
## if the inverse has been computed before, return the cached version. 
## else compute the inverse, save it in cache and return it
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
   ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'

}
